The srsRAN Project is a complete 5G RAN solution, featuring an ORAN-native CU/DU developed by [SRS](http://www.srs.io).

The solution includes a complete L1/2/3 implementation with minimal external dependencies. Portable across processor architectures, the software has been optimized for x86 and ARM. srsRAN follows the 3GPP 5G system architecture implementing the functional splits between distributed unit (DU) and centralized unit (CU). The CU is further disaggregated into control plane (CU-CP) and user-plane (CU-UP).
